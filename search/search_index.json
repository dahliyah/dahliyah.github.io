The word of God is not contained in the Bible alone, it is to be found in tradition as well.

But God\u2019s word is not contained only in them, there is an unwritten word of God also, which we call apostolic tradition. We receive the one and other with equal veneration.</p> <p>The canon of the Ethiopic Bible differs both in the Old and New Testament from that of any other churches. List all books. As a whole, books written in the Geez language and on parchment are numerous. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has 46 books of the Old Testament and 35 books of the New Testament that will bring the total of canonized books of the Bible to 81.</p> <p>These are the following</p> <p>A.

Didascalia</p> <p>The Ethiopic version of the Old and New Testament was made from the Septuagint. It includes the book of Enoch, Baruch, and the third and fourth Esdras. In the international Bible studies there are certain books belonging to the class usually designated pseudepigraphic. The whole Christendom and whole-learned world owes a debt of gratitude to the church of Ethiopia for the preservation of those documents.</p> <p>Among these books is the book of Enoch which throws so much light on Jewish thought on various points during the centuries immediately preceding the Christian era. The book of Jubilee (Kufale, i.e. Division) otherwise known as the Little Genesis has also been preserved entire only in the Ethiopic version. The preservation of yet one more book in its entity, namely, the Ascension of Isaiah, is to be remembered to the credit of the Ethiopic Church.</p> <p>But books, which should be considered for higher education and could be prepared carefully in order to suit modern thinking, are the following.</p> <p>1.

Ancient grammatical books</p> <p>There are very many grammatical books written by different people and found at different places in the world. The above noted are but a very few examples from among the different books numbered by the thousands that the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church has. In the past, at present and even in the future either in the church or at the schools what the church uses for educational services was and will not be outside of these books.</p> <p>In the past, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church had not much opportunity to expand and propagate the above, noted doctrine and orders of the church inside and outside the nation; this is because of the different circumstances prevailing in the surroundings of the country. Because of the advent of European Colonialism upon its neighboring African countries and the great monetary support that other religious groups received to convert Africans. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church had no other choice but to defend on and preserve all here Christian legacy. Henceforth, she was unable to raise her apostolic voice louder among her African brothers and sisters. Nevertheless, the sense of freedom that the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church maintained for centuries being, the torch of freedom to all Africa has enabled Africans to be aware of their freedom.</p> <p>In this 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church is conducting many apostolic missions \u2013 that is organizing church councils and founding clergy training programs within the country; and carrying on her apostolic missionary activities.</p> <p>CANON LAW The canons, regulations of Christian instruction and worship of the Ethiopian Church, are contained in the Sinodos and Didascalia, two compilations of ancient church canons, dating from the second period of Ethiopic literature. These canons are closely associated with the New Testament.</p> <p>The Sinodos, classed as part of Ethiopic New Testament, is composed of various elements: Constitutions of Apostles, the Statutes of the Apostles, the Canons of the Apostles, the canons of Various councils-Nicaea, Gangra, Sardica, Antioch, New-Caesarca, Aneyra, Laodienea \u2013 and various theological and pastoml treatises. Eight books make up the Sinodos. Sinodos is the Corpus juris Ecclesiastic of the Church. The various discourses and treaties included in this Corpus are:</p> <p>1. An exposition of the dialogue ascribed to St. John Chrysostom. 2. On the Essence of the Holy Trinity. 3. On the fear of God. 4. On the ancient people and a refutation of the Jews. 5. A discourse of St. Gregory of Armenia against the Jews. 6. Hortatory discourse to believers who desire to walk in the paths of wisdom and knowledge. 7. Hortatory discourse to believers who desire to walk in the paths of wisdom and knowledge. 8. The discourse of the Nicene Fathers on the Holy Trinity. 9. The penitential canons of our Lord to Peter.</p> <p>The Didascalia a document well known in the Christian Church originally composed in Greek probably in the middle of the third century, a discourse on Church life and society. The whole work was afterwards, somewhere in the fourth century, incorporated in the Apostolic Constitutions. It has Latin, Arabic and Syriac versions, which differ among themselves and from the Ethiopic version with regard to the subject matter. The Ethiopia Didascalia contains the first seven books of the Apostolic Constitutions and it represents a form intermediate between the shorter Syriac Didascalia and the complete work of Apostolic Constitutions.</p> <p>Briefly the contents of the document are: Questions of morality, the duty of studying the Scriptures and observance of the Seventh Commandment, mutual duties of husband and wife, offices and duties of Christian ministers; the duties of widows; the method of baptism, laymen not to baptize; vows of virginity; the duties of the faithful towards the martyrs; observance of Christmas, Epiphany, Lent, Holy week and method of calculating the date of Easter; warning against heresy; respect to be shown to the faithful departed; prayers to be used on specified and unspecified occasions.</p> <p>\u201cGlory be to the Almighty God,\u201d Amen.</p> <p>Source</p> <p>A short history, faith and order of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church, published by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church Holy Synod, Addis Ababa 1983.</p> <p>Edited by Aymero W and Joachim M., The Ethiopian Orthodox Church, published by the Ethiopian Orthodox mission, Addis Ababa 1970.</p>","tags":["bible","deuteronomy","deuteronomy13","jude","jude1"]},{"location":"Canon/Septuagint%20Text%20Family/","title":"Septuagint","text":""},{"location":"Canon/Septuagint%20Text%20Family/#septuagint-text-family-lxx","title":"Septuagint Text Family (LXX)","text":""},{"location":"Canon/Septuagint%20Text%20Family/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>Greek Old Testament / Septuagint</p>"},{"location":"Canon/Septuagint%20Text%20Family/#first-of-the-greek-translations","title":"First of the Greek Translations","text":"<pre><code>title: Aquila of Snope\n[Aquila of Sinope]() - **Aquila** (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05b2\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b7\u05e1 \u02bf\u0103q\u012blas, fl. 130 AD) of Sinope (modern-day Sinop, Turkey; Latin: Aquila Ponticus) was a translator of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, a proselyte, and disciple of *Rabbi Akiva*.</code></pre> <ul> <li>Akiva ben Yosef (Mishnaic Hebrew: \u05e2\u05b2\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05e1\u05b5\u05e3, \u02bf\u0102q\u012b\u1e07\u0101 ben Y\u014ds\u0113p\u0304; c.\u200950 \u2013 28 September 135 CE),[1] also known as Rabbi Akiva (\u05e8\u05b7\u05d1\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 \u05e2\u05b2\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d0), was a leading Jewish scholar and sage, a tanna of the latter part of the first century and the beginning of the second century.
