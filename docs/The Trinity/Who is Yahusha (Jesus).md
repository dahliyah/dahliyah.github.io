## Was Yahusha created?

### Scripture tells us that...
- Yahusha was the **only *begotten* son**.
- He existed **in the *everlasting***.

#### Only Begotten

> [!Bible] [John 3:16 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/john+3:16?translation=kjv) [john](john.md#) [john3](john3.md#)
>  <sup> **16** </sup>For God so loved the world, that he gave his *only begotten Son*, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

The Septuagint presents variations from the translation in the *King James Version* (KJV), which was translated from a **different source** ([Masoretic Text](../Timelines/Events.md#)).
- However, it should be noted that the Septuagint is still incomplete as a section in the verse is missing.
- The screenshot below is from the Blue Letter Bible website. Two Greek words seem to have not been translated and are marked as "Not Available."
