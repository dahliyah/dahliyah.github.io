## Begotten 

*eternally begotten* does not make sense.

## Yahusha raising himself

- John 2:19 - Trinitarian - "*I will raise* it up" "temple of his body"

> [!Bible] [John 2:19-21 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/john+2:19-21?translation=kjv) 
>  <sup> 19 </sup>Jesus answered and said unto them, *Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up* [^1]. <sup> 20 </sup>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? <sup> 21 </sup>But he spake of the temple of his body.
> %% #bible #john #john2 %%

[^1]: He is the Son of Man.

### Power is from his father

- John 10:18 -19

> [!Bible]- [John 10:18-19 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/john+10:18-19?translation=kjv)
>  <sup> 18 </sup>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. <sup> 19 </sup>There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
> 
  [John 10:18-19 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/john+10:18-19?translation=kjv) %% #bible #john #john10 %%

"this commandment I have received **of my Father**"


## Miracles

It's worth noting that the other prophets also performed miracles, not just Yahusha.

> [!Bible] [1 Timothy 2:1-7 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1timothy+2:1-7?translation=kjv) 
<sup> 1 </sup>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; <sup> 2 </sup>For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. <sup> 3 </sup>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; <sup> 4 </sup>Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. <sup> 5 </sup>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; <sup> 6 </sup>Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. <sup> 7 </sup>Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

## "God is Undefinable" ?

Trinitarians hold a distinct interpretation of the term "God""

- The term "God" possesses a distinct essence.
-  Trinity is **idolatry**. Three persons = three gods = *God the Father*, *God the Son*, *God the Holy Spirit*.

>  <sup> 27 </sup>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. <sup> 28 </sup>Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. <sup> 29 </sup>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
