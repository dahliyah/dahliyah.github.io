15:4
And though ye **were** *holy*, *spiritual*, *<span style='color:#0fb9b1'>living the eternal life</span>*, you have defiled yourselves with the blood of women, and have begotten (children) with the blood of flesh, and, as the children of men, have lusted after flesh and blood as those ⌈also⌉ do who die and perish.

15:5
Therefore have I given them wives also that they might impregnate them, and beget children by them, that thus nothing might be wanting to them on earth.

15:6
But you were ⌈formerly⌉ spiritual, living the eternal life, and immortal for all generations of the world.

15:7
And therefore I have not appointed wives for you; for as for the spiritual ones of the heaven, in heaven is their dwelling.

15:8
And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling.
