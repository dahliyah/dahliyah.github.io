content: ### [Aquila of Sinope](Aquila%20of%20Sinope.md#)

Aquila translates bad Greek translation. Passages about the Messiah were reworded in this translation.

Aquila's version is said to have been used in place of the Septuagint in Greek-speaking synagogues. The Christians generally disliked it, alleging that it **rendered the Messianic passages incorrectly**, but Jerome and Origen speak in its praise. Origen incorporated it in his Hexapla.

title: Pope Damascus, Jerome
content: About 380 A.D., athe the suggestion of Pope Damascus, Jerome began a project to translate the entire Bible into Latin.

Jerome began by translating the New Testament (NT), then the Psalms.

As progress continued, **Augustine implored Jerome to translate the Old Testament from the LXX** rather than the present day Hebrew sources.

date: 394 A.D.
title: Augustine, to Jerome
content: >"I beseech you not to devote your labor to the work of translating into Latin the sacred canonical books, unless you... let it be seen plainly what differences there are between this version of yours and that of the Septuagint, whose authority is worthy of highest esteem."

Jerome persisted, translating from the Jewish accepted Hebrew text of his day.

Aided by the pope's political clout, Jerome's Latin Vulgate became the predominant Bible version used throughout the western wolrd.

Although the Eastern churches continued using the LXX, as their influence declined, the LXX mostly faded from memory
