content: ### [Aquila of Sinope](Aquila%20of%20Sinope.md#)

The Greek translation by Aquila of Sinope was corrupted. Specifically, the passages mentioning the Messiah were altered in the rewording.

It is said that Aquila's version was utilized instead of the Septuagint in Greek-speaking synagogues. However, Christians were not fond of it as they claimed that it inaccurately portrayed the Messianic passages. Despite this, Jerome and Origen spoke highly of it and Origen even included it in his Hexapla.

title: Pope Damascus, Jerome
content: About 380 A.D., athe the suggestion of Pope Damascus, Jerome began a project to translate the entire Bible into Latin.

Jerome began by translating the New Testament (NT), then the Psalms.

As progress continued, **Augustine implored Jerome to translate the Old Testament from the LXX** rather than the present day Hebrew sources.

date: 394 A.D.
title: Augustine, to Jerome
content: >"I beseech you not to devote your labor to the work of translating into Latin the sacred canonical books, unless you... let it be seen plainly what differences there are between this version of yours and that of the Septuagint, whose authority is worthy of highest esteem."

Jerome persevered in translating the Jewish accepted Hebrew text of his time. 
With the assistance of the Pope's political influence, his Latin Vulgate became the primary version of the Bible used in the Western world. 

Despite the fact that the Eastern churches continued to use the LXX, its influence decreased, and it gradually faded from memory.
