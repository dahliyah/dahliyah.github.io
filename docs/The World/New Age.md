# New Age

**New Age** is a range of [spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality") or [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion") practices and beliefs which rapidly grew in [Western society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world") during the early 1970s. Its highly [eclectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclecticism "Eclecticism") and unsystematic structure makes a precise definition difficult. Although many scholars consider it a religious movement, its adherents typically see it as spiritual or as unifying Mind-Body-Spirit, and rarely use the term _New Age_ themselves. Scholars often call it the **New Age movement**, although others contest this term and suggest it is better seen as a [_milieu_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment "Social environment") or _[zeitgeist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist "Zeitgeist")_.[^1]

### 1960s

From a historical perspective, the New Age phenomenon is most associated with the [counterculture of the 1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s "Counterculture of the 1960s").
