- Freemasons one must believe in a god, that is a Supreme Being. It can be most any god. 
- Freemasonry accepts a Christian, a Jew, a Buddhist, a Muslim, a Hindu, etc. 
- Freemasonry correctly teaches that there is one God. However, **they assert** that men of *all religions worship the same God using a variety of different names*.

>  <sup> **20** </sup>But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, *they sacrifice to devils*, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. <sup> **21** </sup>**Ye cannot drink** the cup of the Lord, *and the cup of devils*: **ye cannot** be partakers of the Lordâ€™s table, **and** of the *table of devils*. <sup> **22** </sup>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
