# Dispensationalism 

https://www.youtube.com/live/qJJutvi3Ucs?feature=share&t=8046
##### What is Dispensationalism?
Dispensationalism views the Bible as dividing history into different "dispensations" where God interacts with his chosen people in unique ways.

Many dispensationalists hold the belief that following the law has a different standard after the time of Yashusha.

###### 7 Dispensations
1. Innocence
2. Conscience
3. Human Government
4. Promise
5. Law
6. Grace
7. Millenial Kingdom

### Defining Repentance
|Word|Strong's #|Transliteration|Definition|
|----|----|----|----|
|repentance|G3340|metanoeō|to change one's mind, i.e. to repent:: to change one's mind for better, heartily to amend with abhorrence of one's past sins|

to change one's mind for better, heartily to amend with abhorrence of one's **past sins**.

To clarify, we must examine the concept referred to as "sin" which entails violating the *commands* outlined in the Torah or <span style='color:#f7b731'>the Law</span>.

|Word|Strong's #|Definition|
|----|----|----|
|flesh|G4561|the flesh, denotes mere human nature, the earthly nature of man apart from divine influence, and therefore *prone to **sin** and opposed to God*|


**flesh** = prone to *sin* **AND** opposed to God

To start, we should establish a clear definition of what *sin* is, as we understand it to be the violation of Yahuah's **commands**, also known as the *Torah or the law*.


Yahusha was the king of Yisra'el (A nation of people)
Yahusha is our High Priest.
