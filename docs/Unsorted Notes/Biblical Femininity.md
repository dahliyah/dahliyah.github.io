## shamefacedness

- [1] accordingly, **αἰδ**. is prominently objective in its reference, *having regard to others*; while **αἰσχ**. is subjective, *making reference to oneself and one's actions*. Cf. Schmidt, chapter 140. It is often said that '**αἰδ**. *precedes and prevents the shameful act*, **αἰσχ**. *reflects upon its consequences in the shame it brings with it*' (Cope, Aristotle, rhet. 5, 6, 1). **αἰδ**. is *the nobler word*, **αἰσχ**. *the stronger*; while "**αἰδ**. would *always restrain a good man from an unworthy act*, **αἰσχ**. *would sometimes restrain a bad one.*" Trench, §§ 19, 20.]
