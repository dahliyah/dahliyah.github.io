## Was Yahusha created?

### Scripture tells us that...
- Yahusha was the **only *begotten* son**.
- He existed **in the *everlasting***.

#### Only Begotten

> [!Bible] [John 3:16 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/john+3:16?translation=kjv) [[john]] [[john3]]
>  <sup> **16** </sup>For God so loved the world, that he gave his *only begotten Son*, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

The Septuagint presents variations from the translation in the *King James Version* (KJV), which was translated from a **different source** ([[../Timelines/Events|Masoretic Text]]).
- However, it should be noted that the Septuagint is still incomplete as a section in the verse is missing.
- The screenshot below is from the Blue Letter Bible website. Two Greek words seem to have not been translated and are marked as "Not Available."

I archived the page on Archive.org as a precaution.:

#### This is how the Brenton Septuagint Reads

>  <sup> **3** </sup>With thee is dominion in the day of thy power, in the splendours of thy saints: I have begotten thee from the womb before the morning.

#### This is the text in Greek
![[../../Pasted image 20230703031243.png|Pasted image 20230703031243.png]]

#### These are the two words that are "Not Available"
![[../../Pasted image 20230703031327.png|Pasted image 20230703031327.png]]

#### This is the verse translated word for word

With you is the sovereignty in the day of your power, with the brightness of your holy ones, From out of the womb before **the morning star**, I *engendered* you.

Not Available- ἑωσφόρου - morning star
Not Available - ἐξεγέννησά - I engendered
G4771 - you

Google states that the term "engendered" is no longer commonly used and refers to the act of a father begetting offspring.

- The word *firstborn* is used in 2 different ways in scripture.
- The way man uses the word *firstborn* and then there is Yahuah's *firstborn*.

|Man's Firstborn|Yahuah's firstborn|Verses|
|----|----|----|
|H1060 - bᵊḵôr - first-born; hence, chief:—eldest (son), firstborn(-ling).|H1069 - bāḵar - new fruit, to constitute as firstborn, to give the right of the firstborn, to bear early||
|H1067 - bᵊḵîrâ - the eldest daughter:—firstborn.|H1062 - bᵊḵôrâ - birthright, primogeniture, right of the first-born, firstlings||
||G4416 - prōtotokos - from G4413 and the alternate of G5088; first-born (usually as a noun, literally or figuratively):—firstbegotten(-born).|Matthew 1:25, Luke 2:7, Romans 8:29,  Colossians 1:15,  Colossians 1:18,  Hebrews 1:6,  Hebrews 11:28,  Hebrews 12:23, Revelation 1:5|
||G5207 - yhios - the children of Israel, sons of Abraham,  Son of man, Son of God, used to describe those who are born again (Lk. 20:36) and of angels and of Yahusha Messiah, of those whom God esteems as sons, whom he loves, protects and benefits above others, those who revere God as their father, the pious worshippers of God, those who in character and life resemble God, those who are governed by the Spirit of God, repose the same calm and joyful trust in God which children do in their parents (Rom. 8:14, Gal. 3:26), and hereafter in the blessedness and glory of the life eternal will openly wear this dignity of the sons of God. A term used preeminently of Jesus Christ, as enjoying the supreme love of God, united to him in affectionate intimacy, privy to his saving councils, obedient to the Father's will in all his acts||
