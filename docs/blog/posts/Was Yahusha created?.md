## Was Yahusha created?

### Scripture tells us that...
- Yahusha was the **only *begotten* son**.
- He existed **in the *everlasting***.

#### Only Begotten

> [!Bible] [John 3:16 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/john+3:16?translation=kjv) [[../../../John|john]] [[john3]]
>  <sup> **16** </sup>For God so loved the world, that he gave his *only begotten Son*, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
 %% #bible #john #john3 %%

|Word|Strong's #|Transliteration|Definition|
|----|----|----|----|
|only begotten|G3439|monogenēs|mon-og-en-ace'; from G3441 and G1096; only-born, i.e. sole:—only (begotten, child).|
|begotten|G1096|ginomai|to become, i.e. *to come into existence*, begin to be, receive being|

#### In the Everlasting

|everlasting||||

The Septuagint presents variations from the translation in the *King James Version* (KJV), which was translated from a **different source** ([[../../../Events|Masoretic Text]]).
- However, it should be noted that the Septuagint is still incomplete as a section in the verse is missing.
- The screenshot below is from the Blue Letter Bible website. Two Greek words seem to have not been translated and are marked as "Not Available."

### Psalms 110:3

#### This is how the Brenton Septuagint Reads

>  <sup> **3** </sup>With thee is dominion in the day of thy power, in the splendours of thy saints: I have begotten thee from the womb before the morning.

#### These are the two words that are "Not Available"
![[Pasted image 20230703031327.png]]


#### This is the verse translated word for word

With you is the sovereignty in the day of your power, with the brightness of your holy ones, From out of the womb before **the morning star**, I *engendered* you.

Not Available- ἑωσφόρου - morning star
Not Available - ἐξεγέννησά - I engendered
G4771 - you

Google states that the term "engendered" is no longer commonly used and refers to the act of a father begetting offspring.
