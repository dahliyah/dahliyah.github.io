### The Dead in Sheol

> [!bible] [Hebrews 11:3-4 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/58/11/)
>  <sup> **3** </sup>By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible. <sup> **4** </sup>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he **being dead still speaks**.

  [Hebrews](Hebrews.md) [Hebrews 11](Hebrews%2011.md)

> [!bible] [Revelation 6:9-11 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/66/6/)
>  <sup> **9** </sup>When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. <sup> **10** </sup>And **they cried with a loud voice**, saying, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” <sup> **11** </sup>Then *a white robe* was given to each of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both <i>the</i> <i>number</i> <i>of</i> their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they <i>were,</i> was completed.
