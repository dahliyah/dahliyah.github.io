# New Age


> [!quote] Antiquities of the Jews 4:2
> Now it was Nimrod who **excited them to such an affront and contempt of God**. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of great strength of hand. He persuaded them **not to ascribe it to God**, as if it was through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was **their own courage** which procured that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into tyranny, seeing no other way of **turning men from the fear of God**, but to bring them into a constant dependence on his power. He also said he would be revenged on God, if he should have a mind to drown the world again; for that he would build a tower too high for the waters to be able to reach! and that he would avenge himself on God for destroying their forefathers!


**New Age** is a range of [spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality") or [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion") practices and beliefs that rapidly grew in [Western society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world") during the early 1970s. Its highly [eclectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclecticism "Eclecticism") and unsystematic structure makes a precise definition difficult. Although many scholars consider it a religious movement, its adherents typically see it as spiritual or as unifying Mind-Body-Spirit and rarely use the term _New Age_ themselves. Scholars often call it the **New Age movement**, although others contest this term and suggest it is better seen as a [_milieu_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment "Social environment") or _[zeitgeist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist "Zeitgeist")_.[^1]

### 1960s

From a historical perspective, the New Age phenomenon is most associated with the [counterculture of the 1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s "Counterculture of the 1960s").
