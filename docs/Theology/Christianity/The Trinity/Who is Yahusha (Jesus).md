>  <sup> **15** </sup>Who is the [[image]] of the invisible God, *the **firstborn** of every creature*: <sup> **16** </sup>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:

>  <sup> **17** </sup>And *he is before all things, and by him all things consist*. <sup> **18** </sup>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
 %% #bible #colossians #colossians1 %%

- The word *firstborn* is used in 2 different ways in scripture.
- The way man uses the word *firstborn* and then there is Yahuah's *firstborn*.

## The Word


## The First Fruits of the first resurrection

>  <sup> **22** </sup>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. <sup> **23** </sup>But every man in his own order: *Christ the firstfruits*; afterward they that are Christâ€™s at his coming.
 %% #bible #1corinthians #1corinthians15 %%


## Selfless Sacrifice

> [!Bible] [Hebrews 5:6-10 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/HEBREWS+5:6-10?translation=kjv) [[../../../../Hebrews|hebrews]] [[hebrews5]]
>  <sup> **6** </sup>As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. <sup> **7** </sup>Who in the days of his flesh, *when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death*, and was heard in that he feared; <sup> **8** </sup>Though he were a Son, **yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered**; <sup> **9** </sup>And **being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation** unto all them that obey him; <sup> **10** </sup>Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.

Two types of death exist - earthly death and spiritual death. - [[../../../../Two Deaths|Two Deaths]]

>  <sup> **14** </sup>Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. <sup> **15** </sup>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.

- He sacrificed himself in order to ascend to the position of a [[../../../../Priesthood#High Priest|High Priest]] on our behalf.
- The sacrifice of Yahusha through <mark style='background:#20bf6b'>his death does not serve as an atonement for our sins.</mark>


### His Walk


## He has a horse

Yahusha has a horse. Confirmed by a kingdom in context video and also the book that we read yesterday, (**Heaven is for Real** by *Todd Burpo*) followed by the video we saw about the kid who went to heaven and saw that Yahusha had a horse.
