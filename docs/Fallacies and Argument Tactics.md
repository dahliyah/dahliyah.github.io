# Fallacies and Argument Tactics




## Ad Hominems (to the person)


### You Also/Tu Quoque Fallacy

One should not dismiss an argument simply because the person presenting it does not follow their own advice.

- The truth of a claim is not necessarily determined by one's actions.
- The speaker's character is being unfairly attacked instead of effectively countering the argument.

#### Example
>*Person 1*: It is imperative that you cease smoking as it presents a substantial risk to your well-being.
>**Person 2**: It's ironic that you're telling me to quit when you haven't quit yourself.

You may have heard similar responses before, but it's important to note that *Person 1*'s personal health habits are not relevant to the argument being made. The focus is on **Person 2**'s health and the recommendation that they should quit smoking.

## Fallacies of Relevancy

### The Red Herring Fallacy
An individual who argues may attempt to distract their audience by bringing up a topic that is not relevant to the original issue at hand. They may then assert that the original issue has been resolved due to this irrelevant diversion.

- Unnecessary details
-  Raising irrelevant issues

### Appeal to Authority

### Ad Hominem
