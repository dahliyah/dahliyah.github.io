# Spirit


## The Father is Spirit



## Born Again #BornAgainChristian

> Being "born again" is referring to the second death, not a spiritual death of self. 

> [!Bible]- [1 Corinthians 15:42-49 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1Corin+15:42-49?translation=kjv)
> <sup> **42** </sup>So also
is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
> <sup> **43** </sup>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
> <sup> **44** </sup>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
> <sup> **45** </sup>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam
was made a quickening spirit.
> <sup> **46** </sup>Howbeit that
was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
> <sup> **47** </sup>The first man
is of the earth, earthy: the second man
is the Lord from heaven.
> <sup> **48** </sup>As
is the earthy, such
are they also that are earthy: and as
is the heavenly, such
are they also that are heavenly.
> <sup> **49** </sup>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
