# The Law

> Due to the writings of [[../Paul|Paul]] and the way they are worded, Christians believe that the word "[[The Law#What is Law?|law]]" is *ALWAYS* referring to the laws in the old testament. Because of this many believe that the laws mentioned in the old testament is a "curse". That following the law was a curse imposed by God and that we are under a blessing now. This is not entirely the case.

### If you do the Law you have to do it perfectly
We are not under the condemnation of the law because this is the [[The Law#The Law is a curse|curse]] that Yahusha came to destroy. Not that the law is a curse but that being under the condemnation of the law is.

### The Law is a curse

>  <sup> **10** </sup>For as many as are of the [[../Works of the Law|Works of the Law]] are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. <sup> **11** </sup>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is  evident: for, The just shall live by faith. <sup> **12** </sup>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. <sup> **13** </sup>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: <sup> **14** </sup>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
