## “Chained” Women, or Agunot 

*Agunot* are women trapped in marriages because they cannot receive a rabbinic divorce. It's due to their husbands or their husband's male next of kin being unable or unwilling to provide one. The term "*agunot*" comes from the Hebrew word for "<span style='color:#fa8231'>anchor</span>."

In Israel, some men choose to run away to avoid taking responsibility for their families since getting a divorce is quite difficult there.

**STAY WITH YOUR HUSBAND/WIFE**, unless for the obvious reasons.

Divorce was given to us for protection from sin.

### Multiple Wives

>  <sup> **10** </sup>**If** And if he take another to himself, he **shall not** deprive her of *necessaries* and her *apparel*, and her *companionship* [with him]. <sup> **11** </sup>And *if he will not* do these **three** things to her, she *shall go out free* without money.

- [!] This is <mark style='background:#f7b731'>not</mark> a prescription for polygyny. ➕ 2023-07-22

He shall not deprive his first wife of *necessaries*, *apparel*, and *companionship*.

*necessaries/food* - #H7604 - sheh-ayr' -  as living or for food, generally food of any kind, kindred by blood: - body, flesh, food

*apparel/rainment* - #H3682 - kes-ooth' - a cover (garment); figuratively a veiling: - covering, raiment, vesture. 

*companionship/duty of marriage* - #H5772 - o-naw' - from an unused root apparently meaning to dwell together; (sexual) cohabitation: - duty of marriage

 - [n] If someone *does not* provide for his own, meaning wife, wives, and children, especially those in his own house, then his faith (actions/beliefs) do not align with Yah and he is called even WORSE than an unbeliever. 
 - [n] Given that you read scripture and **KNOW** that this is the wrong thing to do, it is as if you willingly deny the commandments. ➕ 2023-07-22
