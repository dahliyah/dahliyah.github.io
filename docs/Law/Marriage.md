### “Chained” Women, or Agunot 
*Agunot* are women trapped in marriages because they cannot receive a rabbinic divorce. It's due to their husbands or their husband's male next of kin being unable or unwilling to provide one. The term "*agunot*" comes from the Hebrew word for "<span style='color:#fa8231'>anchor</span>."

In Israel, some men choose to run away to avoid taking responsibility for their families since getting a divorce is quite difficult there.
