# Marriage

- Yahuah's model is to have ONE wife.


> [!Bible] [Genesis 2:22-24 - LXX](http://qbible.com/brenton-septuagint/genesis/2.html#22) [[../../Genesis|Genesis]] [[Genesis2]]
>  <sup> **22** </sup>And God formed the rib which he took from Adam into a woman, and brought her to Adam. <sup> **23** </sup>And Adam said, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of her husband. <sup> **24** </sup>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and **they two shall be one flesh**.
 %% #bible #Genesis #Genesis2 %%


**Two** shall be *one* flesh.


> [!Bible] [1 Corinthians 7:1-5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1Corinthians+7:1-5?translation=kjv) [[1Corinthians]] [[1Corinthians7]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is  good for a man not to touch a woman. <sup> **2** </sup>Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, **let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.** <sup> **3** </sup>Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. <sup> **4** </sup>The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. <sup> **5** </sup>Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.

## “Chained” Women, or Agunot 

*Agunot* are women trapped in marriages because they cannot receive a rabbinic divorce. It's due to their husbands or their husband's male next of kin being unable or unwilling to provide one. The term "*agunot*" comes from the Hebrew word for "<span style='color:#fa8231'>anchor</span>."

In Israel, some men choose to run away to avoid taking responsibility for their families since getting a divorce is quite difficult there.

<mark style='background:#2d98da'>This does not align with the teachings of the Torah (Yahuah).</mark>

> [!Bible] [Matthew 19:3 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Matthew+19:3?translation=kjv) [[matthew]] [[matthew19]]
>  <sup> **3** </sup>The Pharisees also came unto him, [[../The Trinity/The Trinity#Yahuah cannot be tempted|tempting him]], and saying unto him, *Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for **every cause**?*

> [!Bible] [Matthew 19:4-5 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/matt+19:4-5?translation=kjv) [[matthew]] [[matthew19]]

 %% #bible #matthew #matthew19 %%

**STAY WITH YOUR HUSBAND/WIFE**, unless for the obvious reasons.

Divorce was given to us for protection from sin.

## Polygyny #polygyny

### First Mention
> [!Bible] [Genesis 4:19 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/gen+4:19?translation=kjv) [[../../Genesis|genesis]] [[../../genesis4|genesis4]]

### Multiple Wives

> [!Bible] [Exodus 21:10-11 - LXX](http://qbible.com/brenton-septuagint/exodus/21.html#10) [[../../Exodus|exodus]] [[exodus21]]
>  <sup> **10** </sup>**If** And if he take another to himself, he **shall not** deprive her of *necessaries* and her *apparel*, and her *companionship* [with him]. <sup> **11** </sup>And *if he will not* do these **three** things to her, she *shall go out free* without money.
 %% #bible #exodus #exodus21 %%
 
- [!] This is <mark style='background:#f7b731'>not</mark> a prescription for polygyny. ➕ 2023-07-22

He shall not deprive his first wife of *necessaries*, *apparel*, and *companionship*.

*necessaries/food* - #H7604 - sheh-ayr' -  as living or for food, generally food of any kind, kindred by blood: - body, flesh, food

*apparel/rainment* - #H3682 - kes-ooth' - a cover (garment); figuratively a veiling: - covering, raiment, vesture. 

*companionship/duty of marriage* - #H5772 - o-naw' - from an unused root apparently meaning to dwell together; (sexual) cohabitation: - duty of marriage

> [!Bible] [1 Timothy 5:8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1tim+5:8?translation=kjv) [[1timothy]] [[1timothy5]]
>  <sup> **8** </sup>But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is *worse* than an **infidel**.
 %% #bible #1timothy #1timothy5 %%

<br>


 - [n] If someone *does not* provide for his own, meaning wife, wives, and children, especially those in his own house, then his faith (actions/beliefs) do not align with Yah and he is called even WORSE than an unbeliever. 
 - [n] Given that you read scripture and **KNOW** that this is the wrong thing to do, it is as if you willingly deny the commandments. ➕ 2023-07-22

### Sexual Immorality / Fornication
Fornication = Bad Behavior

### Divorce

> [!Bible] [Mark 10:4 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Mark+10:4?translation=kjv) [[Mark]] [[Mark10]]
>  <sup> **4** </sup>And they said, Moses suffered to **write a bill of divorcement**, *and* to **put her away**.
 %% #bible #Mark #Mark10 %%

- You must do both to be **divorced**.

#### Putting Away

> [!Bible] [Deuteronomy 22:19 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/deu+22:19?translation=kjv) [[deuteronomy]] [[deuteronomy22]]
>  <sup> **19** </sup>And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not **put her away** all his days.
 %% #bible #deuteronomy #deuteronomy22 %%

| put away | #G630      | apolyō          | ap-ol-oo'-o   | to free fully, i.e. (literally) relieve, release, dismiss (reflexively, depart), or (figuratively) let die, pardon or (specially) divorce:—(let) depart, dismiss, divorce, forgive, let go, loose, put (send) away, release, set at liberty. |  

To <mark style='background:#2d98da'>put away</mark> does **NOT** mean to *divorce*.

Matthew 14:15 - “dismiss”
Matthew 14:22 - “dissmissed”
Matthew 14:23 - “dismissed”
Matthew 15:23 - “Send her away”
Matthew 15:32 - “Send them away”

> [!Bible] [Matthew 5:32 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Matthew+5:32?translation=kjv) [[Matthew]] [[Matthew5]]
>  <sup> **32** </sup>But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of *fornication*, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is <mark style='background:#8854d0'>divorced</mark> committeth adultery.
 %% #bible #Matthew #Matthew5 %%

The word “*divorced*” in this verse is Strong’s #G630, the word *apolyo* which as we know now means **set free**.

So the end of the verse should read:  and whosoever shall marry her that is *set free* committeth adultery.

*Set free*, but **NOT** *divorced*, meaning that they have not received the <u><span style='color:#f7b731'>certificate of divorce</span></u> yet.

> [!Bible] [Deuteronomy 24:1-4 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Deuteronomy+24:1-4?translation=kjv) [[Deuteronomy]] [[Deuteronomy24]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her **a bill of divorcement**, and give it in her hand, and **send her out of his house**. <sup> **2** </sup>And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife. <sup> **3** </sup>And if the latter husband hate her, and write her **a bill of divorcement**, and giveth it in her hand, and **sendeth her out of his house**; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife; <sup> **4** </sup>Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

### Slander

A man who *slanders* his wife with accusations of adultery **must**
- remain married to his wife.
- not divorce her
