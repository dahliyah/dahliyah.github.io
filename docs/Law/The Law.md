# The Law

> Due to the writings of [[../Bodies/Earthly/Scripture/Paul/Paul|Paul]] and the way they are worded, Christians believe that the word "[[The Law#What is Law?|law]]" is *ALWAYS* referring to the laws in the old testament. Because of this many believe that the laws mentioned in the old testament is a "curse". That following the law was a curse imposed by God and that we are under a blessing now. This is not entirely the case.
