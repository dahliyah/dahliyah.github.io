>  <sup> **19** </sup>For though I be free from all men, yet have I *made myself servant* unto all, that I might gain the more. <sup> **20** </sup>And *unto the Jews I became as a Jew*, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; <sup> **21** </sup>To them that are without law, as without law, (**being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ**,) *that I might gain them that are without law.* <sup> **22** </sup>*To the weak became I as weak*, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

So these three sections is Paul meeting people where they are, partaking in the same so as to be the same, for the end goal of spreading the word.. (**that i might gain**)
