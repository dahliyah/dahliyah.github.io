# The Law

![[./The Law Diagram.canvas|The Law Diagram]]


The law was given before Moses received them on Mount Sinai.
We are not under the new covenant yet.

### What is Law?

|Word|Strong's #|Transliteration|Phonetic|Definition|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|law|H8451|tôrâ|to-raw'|law, direction, instruction|


- [!] Mount Sinai = Renewal of Covenant = [[How do we celebrate it | Shabbu'ot ]]



> [!Bible]- [Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/ecc+12:13-14?translation=kjv) 
>  <sup> 13 </sup>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. <sup> 14 </sup>For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

## Do we have to keep the law?

> [!Bible] [Matthew 7:22-23 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/matt+7:22-23?translation=kjv) [[matthew]] [[matthew7]]
>  <sup> **22** </sup>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? <sup> **23** </sup>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work **iniquity**[^1].
 %% #bible #matthew #matthew7 %%

Some translations say *lawlessness* instead of **iniquity**.

- [n] **My Comments**: Faith without works is dead. Works meaning action and character. If your fruits and character do not bear the fruit of Yah, then you are working iniquity, lawlessness. How do we bear the fruit of Yah? We do his commands, these are the instructions of righteousness.  Faith in Yah and Yahusha is shown by your actions. Faith does not only mean believing that "Jesus died for you on the cross" which is not the full story I might add, but I digress, it means that you must align your character in the same way that Yah walked. And again how did he walk? [[../The Trinity/Who is Yahusha (Jesus)#His Walk|Who is Yahusha (Jesus) > His Walk]]➕ 2023-07-21

> [!Bible] [James 2:14-18 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/James+2:14-18?translation=kjv) [[james]] [[james2]]
>  <sup> **14** </sup>What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? <sup> **15** </sup>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, <sup> **16** </sup>And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? <sup> **17** </sup>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. <sup> **18** </sup>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.

## Law of Moses // Law of Mashiach

The law *of* Moses is not **FROM** Moses but **FROM** <mark style='background:#8854d0'>Yah</mark> who sent Moses to remind the children of Israel of this message.

## Paul

> [!Bible] [Galatians 6:2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/gal+6:2?translation=kjv) [[../../galatians|galatians]] [[galatians6]]
>  <sup> **2** </sup>Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
 %% #bible #galatians #galatians6 %%

> [!Bible] [1 Corinthians 9:19-22 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1corinthia+9:19-22?translation=kjv) [[1corinthians]] [[1corinthians9]]
>  <sup> **19** </sup>For though I be free from all men, yet have I *made myself servant* unto all, that I might gain the more. <sup> **20** </sup>And *unto the Jews I became as a Jew*, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; <sup> **21** </sup>To them that are without law, as without law, (**being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ**,) *that I might gain them that are without law.* <sup> **22** </sup>*To the weak became I as weak*, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.
 %% #bible #1corinthians #1corinthians9 %%

**made myself servant** - he was kind, serving others with kindness, helping them.

*unto the Jews I became as a Jew*
- as a Jew = Traditions of Men. Following [[Laws of Men]]. 

##### that I might gain them that are without law
So these three sections is Paul meeting people where they are, partaking in the same so as to be the same, for the end goal of spreading the word.. (**that i might gain**)

> [!Bible] [Hebrews 10:28 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/hebrews+10:28?translation=kjv) [[hebrews]] [[hebrews10]]

> [!Bible] [Acts 13:38-39 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/act+13:38-39?translation=kjv) [[acts]] [[acts13]]
>  <sup> **38** </sup>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: <sup> **39** </sup>And by him all that believe are <mark style='background:#20bf6b'>justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</mark>
 %% #bible #acts #acts13 %%

### Works of the Law
#### Romans 3:20

> [!Bible] [Romans 3:20 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/romans+3:20?translation=kjv) [[romans]] [[romans3]]
>  <sup> **20** </sup>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
 %% #bible #romans #romans3 %%
 
- [n] My guess is that the "works of the law" are the extra man-made pharisaical laws placed on the Yahudiym. ➕ 2023-07-21

### "The Law is a curse"

> [!Bible] [Galatians 3:10-14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/gal+3:10-14?translation=kjv) [[../../galatians|galatians]] [[galatians3]]
>  <sup> **10** </sup>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. <sup> **11** </sup>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is  evident: for, The just shall live by faith. <sup> **12** </sup>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. <sup> **13** </sup>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: <sup> **14** </sup>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
