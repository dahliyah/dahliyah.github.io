And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. <sup> **7** </sup>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

### Paul Kept the Law

>  <sup> **20** </sup>And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: <sup> **21** </sup>And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. <sup> **22** </sup>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. <sup> **23** </sup>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; <sup> **24** </sup>Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.

>  <sup> **5** </sup>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. <sup> **6** </sup>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate. <sup> **7** </sup>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

>  <sup> **14** </sup>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. <sup> **15** </sup>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? <sup> **16** </sup>Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. <sup> **17** </sup>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. <sup> **18** </sup>He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. <sup> **19** </sup>**Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?** Why go ye about to kill me?

Yahusha was talking to the Pharisees here. This means they were not following the law given to Moses by Yah to the children of Yashar'el.



- [!] The Pharisees were following their own man-made laws. âž• 2023-07-21
