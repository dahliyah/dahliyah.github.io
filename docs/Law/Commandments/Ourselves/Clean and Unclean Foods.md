> [!Bible] [Ezekiel 22:26-28 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/ezekiel+22:26-28?translation=kjv) [[../../../../Ezekiel|ezekiel]] [[ezekiel22]]
>  <sup> **26** </sup>Her priests have *violated my law*, and have **profaned mine holy things**: they have put no difference *between* the **holy** and **profane**, neither have they shewed *difference* between the **unclean** and the **clean**, and have *hid their eyes from my sabbaths*, and I am profaned among them. <sup> **27** </sup>Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain. <sup> **28** </sup>And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter,  seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, **saying**, *Thus saith the Lord GOD*, **when the LORD hath not spoken**.
