> [!Bible] [Exodus 35:2-3 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/exo+35:2-3?translation=kjv) [[../../../Exodus|exodus]] [[exodus35]]
>  <sup> **2** </sup>Six days shall *work* be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death. <sup> **3** </sup>**Ye shall kindle no fire** throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.

**kindling fire** is referring to occupational *work*, not cooking.

>  <sup> **15** </sup>Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. <sup> **16** </sup>And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of *work* shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. <sup> **17** </sup>And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.

You were supposed to have bought everything you needed to celebrate the sabbath. Have everything in your dwelling so as not to have to go out and work to get or purchase things from outside the home so that you may rest from work.


> [!Bible] [[../../../Chapter 50|Jubilees 50:9-10]] [[jubilees]] [[jubilees50]]
>  <sup> **9** </sup> Ye shall do *no work* whatever on the Sabbath day save what ye have prepared for yourselves on the sixth day, so as to eat, and drink, and rest, and keep Sabbath from all work on that day, and to bless the Lord your God, who has given you a day of festival and a holy day: and a day of the holy kingdom for all Israel is this day among their days for ever. <sup>**10**</sup> For great is the honour which the Lord has given to Israel that they should eat and drink and be satisfied on this festival day, and rest thereon from all labour which belongs to the labour of the children of men save burning frankincense and bringing oblations and sacrifices before the Lord for days and for Sabbaths.
