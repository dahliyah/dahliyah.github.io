- [?] Are we not to leave house according to Exodus 16:29? ➕ 2023-08-26

No this does not say we are not to leave our houses. This was specific to the Hebrews at that time because the manna would melt in the sun.
## Cooking on the Sabbath

> [!Bible] [Exodus 35:2-3 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/exo+35:2-3?translation=kjv) [[../../../Exodus|exodus]] [[exodus35]]
>  <sup> **2** </sup>*Six days* shall *work* be done, but on the **seventh day** there shall be to you an **holy day**, **a sabbath of rest** to the LORD: whosoever doeth *work* therein shall be put to death. <sup> **3** </sup>**Ye shall kindle no fire** throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
 %% #bible #exodus #exodus35 %%

**kindling fire** is referring to occupational *work* which involved laborious work like building a fire, not cooking in your home on the Sabbath.
