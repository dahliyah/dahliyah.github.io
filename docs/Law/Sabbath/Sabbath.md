- [?] Are we not to leave house according to Exodus 16:29? ➕ 2023-08-26
No this does not say we are not to leave our houses. This was specific to the Hebrews at that time because the manna would melt in the sun.

### Jubilees 2:29
#### *Prepare* in this context means to **make ready** or **gather**.

- Procuring ingredients, going out to purchase food items, going out to buy water or anything that you may need is a form of physical exertion or labor.

> [!bible] [[Apocrypha/jubilees#Chapter 2#2 29|Jubilees 2:29]] - YAH
>  <sup> **29** </sup>Declare and say to the children of Israel the law of this day that they should keep Sabbath on it, and that they should not forsake it in the error of their hearts; and that it is not lawful to do any work on it which is not suitable, to do their own pleasure on it, and that they should not prepare anything to be eaten or drunk on it, and that it is not lawful to draw water, or bring in or take out through their gates any burden which they had not prepared for themselves on the sixth day in their dwellings.
