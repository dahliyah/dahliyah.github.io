>  <sup> **15** </sup>What then? **shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace**? God forbid. <sup> **16** </sup>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? <sup> **17** </sup>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. <sup> **18** </sup>*Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness*.

- He is talking to converts here.
- They are no longer to follow the laws/ways of the Romans, but instead to follow the laws of Yahuah

Thoughts: He is saying that we should not transgress the law-*sin*, just because we are under Yah's grace.

Free of Sin = Servants of Righteousness
