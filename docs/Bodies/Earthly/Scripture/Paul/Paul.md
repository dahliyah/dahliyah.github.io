# Paul

<br><br>


## Paul Taught the Law

![![docs/Bodies/Earthly/Scripture/#^Table]


Law - #H8451 - tôrâ - law, direction, instruction
### Romans Chapter 6
> [!Bible] [Romans 6:15-18 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+6:15-18?translation=kjv) [[romans]] [[romans6]]
>  <sup> **15** </sup>What then? **shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace**? God forbid. <sup> **16** </sup>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? <sup> **17** </sup>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. <sup> **18** </sup>*Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness*.
 %% #bible #romans #romans6 %%

- He is talking to converts here.
- They are no longer to follow the laws/ways of the Romans, but instead to follow the laws of Yahuah

Thoughts: He is saying that we should not transgress the law-*sin*, just because we are under Yah's grace.

Free of Sin = Servants of Righteousness

We are servants of righteousness. How is righteousness defined in the bible? God’s commands.

#### What is Righteousness?

Law in the heart - can not people grow in their understanding of walking in Messiah?



## Followed the Law


| Law                       | Verses (Acts)                   |

| Made Vows                 |                 18:18, 21:23-26 |
| Observing [[Fasts]]           |                            27:9 |
| Observing [[../../../../Law/Sabbath/Sabbath|Sabbath]]         | 13:14, 42, 44,16:13, 17:2, 18:4 |

| [[../../../../../Worship\|Worshipping]] at the [[Temple]] |            22:17, 24:11, 18, 18 |
| Keeping [[../../../../Law/The Law\|the Law]]           |        21:24, 22:3, 23:6, 24:14 |  





> [!Bible] [Galatians 6:2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/gal+6:2?translation=kjv) [[../../../../../galatians|galatians]] [[galatians6]]
>  <sup> **2** </sup>Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
 %% #bible #galatians #galatians6 %%

> [!Bible] [1 Corinthians 9:19-22 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1corinthia+9:19-22?translation=kjv) [[1corinthians]] [[1corinthians9]]
>  <sup> **19** </sup>For though I be free from all men, yet have I *made myself servant* unto all, that I might gain the more. <sup> **20** </sup>And *unto the Jews I became as a Jew*, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; <sup> **21** </sup>To them that are without law, as without law, (**being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ**,) *that I might gain them that are without law.* <sup> **22** </sup>*To the weak became I as weak*, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.
 %% #bible #1corinthians #1corinthians9 %%

**made myself servant** - he was kind, serving others with kindness, helping them.

*unto the Jews I became as a Jew*
- as a Jew = [[Traditions of Men]]. Following [[Laws of Men]]. 

##### that I might gain them that are without law
So these three sections is Paul meeting people where they are, partaking in the same so as to be the same, for the end goal of spreading the word.. (**that i might gain**)

> [!Bible] [Hebrews 10:28 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/hebrews+10:28?translation=kjv) [[hebrews]] [[hebrews10]]
>  <sup> **28** </sup>He that *despised Moses’ law* died **without mercy** under two or three witnesses:

> [!Bible] [Acts 13:38-39 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/act+13:38-39?translation=kjv) [[acts]] [[acts13]]
>  <sup> **38** </sup>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: <sup> **39** </sup>And by him all that believe are <mark style='background:#20bf6b'>justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</mark>
