# Paul




## Taught the Law

![![docs/Bodies/Earthly/Scripture/#^Table]


Law - #H8451 - tôrâ - law, direction, instruction
### Romans Chapter 6
> [!Bible] [Romans 6:15-18 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+6:15-18?translation=kjv) [[romans]] [[romans6]]
>  <sup> **15** </sup>What then? **shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace**? God forbid. <sup> **16** </sup>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? <sup> **17** </sup>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. <sup> **18** </sup>*Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness*.

- He is talking to converts here.
- They are no longer to follow the laws/ways of the Romans, but instead to follow the laws of Yahuah

Thoughts: He is saying that we should not transgress the law-*sin*, just because we are under Yah's grace.

Free of Sin = Servants of Righteousness

#### What is Righteousness?
